    Content: >
      - I'm Hamza Anver, from Sri Lanka, currently a Junior at New York University, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Engineering.

      -

      - I have a strong interest in embedded systems, electronics, computers, game development, cats, and other related subjects.

      -

      - During the summer of 2024, I interned at [**Sri Lanka Telecom's Digital Lab**](https://www.sltdigitallab.lk/), where I contributed to projects such as [**generating synthetic data**](/projects/sltdl24/anpr/) for training ML models on Sri Lankan license plates. I also developed an [**embedded library**](/projects/sltdl24/mqttcomms/) for Industrial IoT, which facilitated MQTT communication and updates via LTE and WiFi.

      -

      - In the Spring and summer of 2023, I was part of [**nyuad.space**](https://nyuad-space.github.io/), a rocketry team of five Engineering and Computer Science students based in NYUAD’s Engineering Design Studio. My contributions included working on an [**HDRM in collaboration with JUCI**](/projects/nyuadspace23/jucihdrm/), the [**HALOSHIP high-powered amateur rocket**](/projects/nyuadspace23/haloship/), and [**Rocat v1.1**](/projects/nyuadspace23/rocat/), a custom high-speed data logger and flight computer.

      -

      - Additionally, I enjoy working on personal projects. A recent one is a web-based [**Gridfinity Generator**](https://hamza-anver.github.io/Gridfinity-Generator/), inspired by Zack Freedman (VoidStarLab)'s Gridfinity system.
