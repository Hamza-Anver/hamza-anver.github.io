While I was on the nyuad.space team, I was able to work on HALOSHIP, a high powered amateur rocket.

The rocket is fully reusable, with no external screws, shear pins, or epoxy, instead, it relies on an entirely mechanical substructure. The approach to the design of HALOSHIP was similar to the HDRM, i.e. a simulation-first approach - before fabrication, parts were sent through several sets of simulations utilizing OnShape and OpenRocketâ€™s simulation capabilities. As an example the design of the fins went through dozens of rounds of simulations to avoid aeroelastic flutter, other components went through finite element analysis to ensure they could withstand the forces of launch.

It was successfully launched to a target altitude of 10,000 feet and recovered in June 2023 in New Mexico, USA. The radical new approach to hobbyist rocketry demonstrated by the team was recognized by judges and nyuad.space was awarded 2nd Place in the Dr. Gil Moore Award for Innovation.
