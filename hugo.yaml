    Content: >
      - I'm Hamza Anver, from Sri Lanka and current a Junior at New York University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Engineering.


      - I'm interested in embedded systems, cats, electronics, computers, game dev and a bunch of other tangential subjects.

      - In the Summer of 2024, I interned at [**Sri Lanka Telecom's Digital Lab**](https://www.sltdigitallab.lk/), where I worked on [**generating synthetic data**](/projects/sltdl24/anpr/) to train an ML model on Sri Lankan License Plates. I also worked on an 
      [**embedded library**](/projects/sltdl24/mqttcomms/) for Industrial IoT to facilitate configuration of MQTT communication and updates via LTE and WiFi.

      -

      - In the Spring and Summer of 2023, I worked in [**nyuad.space**](https://nyuad-space.github.io/), a rocketry team of five Engineering and Computer Science students based in NYUAD’s Engineering Design Studio. 
      During my time on the team, I contributed to: [**an HDRM in collaboration with JUCI**](/projects/nyuadspace/hdrm/), the [**HALOSHIP high-powered amateur rocket**](/projects/nyuadspace/haloship/), and [**Rocat v1.1**](/projects/nyuadspace/rocat/) - a custom high-speed data logger and flight computer.

      -

      - Beyond that I also work on personal projects, a recent one is a web based [**Gridfinity Generator**](https://hamza-anver.github.io/Gridfinity-Generator/), based on Zack Freedman (VoidStarLab)'s Gridfinity.
