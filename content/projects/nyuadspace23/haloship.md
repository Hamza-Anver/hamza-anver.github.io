While I was part of the nyuad.space team, I had the opportunity to work on HALOSHIP, a high-powered amateur rocket.

<!--more-->

HALOSHIP is a fully reusable rocket that doesn't rely on external screws, shear pins, or epoxy. Instead, it uses a completely mechanical substructure. The design approach for HALOSHIP was similar to the HDRM project, employing a simulation-first methodology. Before any fabrication occurred, components were subjected to extensive simulations using OnShape and OpenRocket. For instance, the fin design underwent dozens of simulation rounds to prevent aeroelastic flutter, while other parts were analyzed with finite element methods to ensure they could withstand the forces encountered during launch.

HALOSHIP was successfully launched to its target altitude of 10,000 feet and recovered in June 2023 in New Mexico, USA. The innovative approach to hobbyist rocketry demonstrated by the team earned recognition from the judges, and nyuad.space was awarded 2nd Place in the Dr. Gil Moore Award for Innovation.
